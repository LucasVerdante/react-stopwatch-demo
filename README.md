# React Stopwatch

## Challenge Description

Please build a simple stopwatch app in React with lap/stop/start buttons. This can be designed however you want. We will be looking at how components and code is structured and how you approach UI. This can either be zipped up and sent back via email or if you want to do it on public github a link to that would be great!

it's ideally not meant to take too long, so we understand if it isn't 100% polished. meaning we won't be running it in IE11 or through a screen reader, etc
